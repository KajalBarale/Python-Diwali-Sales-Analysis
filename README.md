# Python-Diwali-Sales-Analysis
Sales analysis repository in Python, using Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib for insightful analysis and captivating visualizations

This project showcases comprehensive sales analysis using Python libraries like Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. The workflow begins with data importing, followed by exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data cleaning. During cleaning, unnecessary columns are removed, null values are handled, and columns are renamed and formatted.

Visualizations play a key role in understanding the data. Bar charts illustrate gender distribution and order counts. Additionally, insights into the top 10 states by order count and total sales amount are provided. Notably, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka emerge as the top contributors.

Furthermore, marital status analysis reveals that married women exhibit significant purchasing power. Occupation analysis highlights IT, healthcare, and aviation sectors as prominent buyers. Product category analysis showcases the dominance of food, clothing, and electronics categories in sales.
